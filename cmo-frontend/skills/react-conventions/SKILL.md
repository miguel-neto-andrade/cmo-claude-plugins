# React Conventions

Conventions for React 18+ + TypeScript in C-Mo repositories. Built on the modern React defaults (function components, hooks, Vite or Next.js) plus the project-specific rules below.

## Where logic lives — the rule that comes first

**No business logic on the frontend.** The frontend renders state, collects input, shows validation feedback, and orchestrates API calls — nothing more. Anything that decides *what should happen* lives on the backend.

Business logic is anything that would:

- Compute a value the backend will also need to trust (pricing, taxes, fees, eligibility, scoring).
- Decide whether an action is permitted (authorisation, role checks, business-rule enforcement).
- Persist or transform domain state (workflow transitions, status changes, derived records).
- Enforce a domain invariant (e.g. "an order can't have more than 10 line items").

The frontend may **mirror** that logic for UX (disable a button while the API call is in flight, hide a menu item the user can't use, surface inline validation hints) — but the source of truth is the backend, and the backend must re-check every constraint. If the frontend is the only place a rule exists, the rule does not exist.

What's allowed on the frontend:

- **Presentation logic** — sorting / filtering an already-loaded list, formatting dates, currency, addresses.
- **UX state** — modal open/closed, accordion expanded, current tab, form draft.
- **Input validation as a hint** — `required`, `min`, `max`, basic shape checks. Always re-validated server-side.
- **API call orchestration** — when to fetch, when to retry, when to invalidate (TanStack Query handles most of this).

If you find yourself reaching for a lot of conditional logic in a component or custom hook, ask: *is this a decision the backend would care about?* If yes, it belongs on the backend.

## React language fundamentals

- **Function components + hooks** for every new component. Class components are legacy only.
- **TypeScript with `"strict": true`** in every `tsconfig.json`. Type errors fail the build.
- **One component per file**, file name matches the component (`UserCard.tsx`).
- **No HOC towers**, no render-prop gymnastics. Use hooks.
- **No global event bus.** Use props, context, or a store.

## Project structure

```
src/
├── main.tsx
├── App.tsx
├── router/             ← React Router config
├── stores/             ← Zustand stores (or Context for narrow trees)
├── api/                ← TanStack Query queries + mutations, grouped by resource
├── hooks/              ← useFoo() reusable hooks
├── components/         ← reusable components
├── pages/              ← route-target components
├── layouts/            ← app shell
├── types/              ← shared TS types and API DTOs
├── assets/             ← images, fonts, global styles
└── lib/                ← http client, utils
```

Group by feature inside `components/`, `pages/`, and `stores/` once a folder has more than ~20 components. Avoid one mega-folder of every component in the app.

## Component structure

```tsx
import { useMemo } from 'react';
import type { Invoice } from '@/types/invoice';

type InvoiceCardProps = {
  invoice: Invoice;
  compact?: boolean;
  onApprove: (id: string) => void;
  onReject: (id: string, reason: string) => void;
};

export function InvoiceCard({ invoice, compact = false, onApprove, onReject }: InvoiceCardProps) {
  const total = useMemo(
    () => formatCurrency(invoice.amount, invoice.currency),
    [invoice.amount, invoice.currency],
  );

  return (
    <article className={`invoice-card ${compact ? 'is-compact' : ''}`}>
      <h3>{invoice.number}</h3>
      <p>{total}</p>
      <button onClick={() => onApprove(invoice.id)}>Approve</button>
    </article>
  );
}
```

- **Named exports**, not default. Better for refactors, IDE rename, and grep.
- **`Props` type alias** with the `Props` suffix. Use `interface` only when actually extending one.
- **Don't destructure all props in the signature** when there are many — pull them inside the body for readability.

## Naming

| Thing | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Component file | PascalCase, matches component | `UserCard.tsx` |
| Hook | `camelCase`, prefix `use` | `useInvoiceList` |
| Store | `camelCase`, prefix `use`, suffix `Store` | `useInvoicesStore` |
| Props type | PascalCase, suffix `Props` | `UserCardProps` |
| Event handler prop | prefix `on`, PascalCase verb | `onSubmit`, `onRowClick` |
| Boolean prop | prefix `is`/`has`/`can` | `isLoading`, `hasError`, `canEdit` |

English everywhere — names, comments, log messages, copy.

## State management

Three buckets — pick the one that fits, don't reach for a heavier tool than needed.

### Server state — TanStack Query (default)

Use TanStack Query for anything fetched from an API: caching, deduplication, background refetch, loading / error states, optimistic updates. Replaces hand-rolled `useEffect` + `useState` loading/error scaffolding.

```ts
// src/api/invoices.ts
import { useQuery, useMutation, useQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { http } from '@/lib/http';
import type { Invoice } from '@/types/invoice';

export const invoicesQueryKeys = {
  all: ['invoices'] as const,
  list: (filters: { status?: string } = {}) =>
    [...invoicesQueryKeys.all, 'list', filters] as const,
  detail: (id: string) => [...invoicesQueryKeys.all, 'detail', id] as const,
};

export function useInvoices(filters: { status?: string } = {}) {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: invoicesQueryKeys.list(filters),
    queryFn: () => http.get<Invoice[]>('/api/invoices', { params: filters }),
  });
}

export function useApproveInvoice() {
  const qc = useQueryClient();
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: (id: string) => http.post<Invoice>(`/api/invoices/${id}/approve`),
    onSuccess: (data, id) => {
      qc.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: invoicesQueryKeys.all });
      qc.setQueryData(invoicesQueryKeys.detail(id), data);
    },
  });
}
```

Conventions:

- **Hierarchical query keys** — `[resource, scope, params]` — so `invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['invoices'] })` invalidates everything under `invoices`. Wrap them in a `queryKeys` object per resource so you never typo a key in two places.
- **One file per resource** under `api/` — co-locate queries, mutations, and the query-key object.
- **Never call `fetch` / `axios` directly from a component.** Always go through a TanStack Query hook so the cache layer stays consistent.
- **No global loading flag.** Each query exposes its own `isLoading` / `isFetching`. Compose in the component if you really need an aggregate.

### Client state — Zustand (default) / Context (narrow)

Zustand for cross-component client state. Context for narrow trees (theme, current user) where you don't need selectors. Redux Toolkit only in existing projects that already use it.

```ts
// src/stores/auth.ts
import { create } from 'zustand';
import type { User } from '@/types/user';

type AuthState = {
  user: User | null;
  setUser: (u: User | null) => void;
};

export const useAuthStore = create<AuthState>((set) => ({
  user: null,
  setUser: (user) => set({ user }),
}));
```

- One store per concern. Don't make a single `useAppStore` that holds everything.
- **Don't keep server data in Zustand.** TanStack Query owns it. Stores that mirror server entities go stale and cause double-source bugs.

### Local state — `useState` / `useReducer`

Default. Anything that lives and dies with the component. `useReducer` for multi-field state machines or when next-state depends on previous-state.

## Props, children, refs

- **Typed props** with a `Props` type alias.
- **`children: ReactNode`** when the component accepts arbitrary children.
- **Never mutate props.** Compute via `useMemo` or seed `useState` with a prop value (then it becomes local state).
- **`forwardRef`** only when a parent genuinely needs to reach into a DOM node. Don't expose refs as a generic API.
- **Boolean props default to `false`.** Don't pass `={true}` — just write the prop name.

## Hooks

- **Rules of Hooks** — top level only, never in conditionals, never in loops. The ESLint plugin enforces this; don't disable it.
- **Custom hooks return an object**, not an array (unless mirroring `useState`'s tuple).
- **`useEffect` is a last resort.** Most reasons you'd reach for it (data fetching, derived state from props) belong in TanStack Query or a `useMemo`. Use `useEffect` only for genuine side effects (subscriptions, imperative DOM, third-party libs).
- **`useCallback` / `useMemo`** — only when a measured profile shows a problem, or when the value feeds into a dependency array of another hook. Reflexive memoisation everywhere is noise.
- **One file per custom hook**, named after the function.

## Routing — React Router 6

- **Data routers (`createBrowserRouter`)** for new apps. The legacy `<BrowserRouter>` + `<Routes>` pattern works but loses loaders / actions.
- **Lazy-load route elements** — `lazy: () => import('@/pages/InvoiceDetail').then(m => ({ Component: m.InvoiceDetail }))`.
- **Loaders for navigation gating only** (e.g. redirect unauthenticated users), not for primary data fetching — TanStack Query owns that, and mixing loaders with the query cache produces coordination bugs. Let the page's `useQuery` fetch the data.
- **`<Link>` / `<NavLink>`** — never hand-roll `<a href>` for in-app navigation. Hand-rolled anchors break the SPA.

## Forms

- **React Hook Form** + Zod resolver as the default. Performant (uncontrolled by default), TS-friendly, plays well with TanStack Query mutations.
- **Schema-first validation** with Zod. The schema is the contract; the form derives field types and validation from it.
- **Client validation is a UX hint, never a security boundary.** The backend re-validates every field.
- **Submit handler calls a TanStack Query mutation.** The mutation owns loading / error / success state.

## Performance

- **Don't reach for `React.memo` reflexively.** It only helps when re-renders are measurable and the component is genuinely pure.
- **`useMemo` / `useCallback`** — same caveat. Profile first.
- **Code-split routes** (lazy-load, above).
- **Virtualised lists** — `@tanstack/react-virtual` for thousands of rows. Don't render 5 000 DOM nodes.
- **Suspense + Error Boundaries** for async UI — wrap routes / sections, not individual components.

## Accessibility

The frontend is the only place a11y exists. Take it seriously.

- **Semantic HTML first.** `<button>` not `<div onClick>`. `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>` for landmarks. ARIA only when no semantic element fits.
- **Every interactive element is keyboard reachable.** Tab order matches visual order. Focus is visible — don't strip the outline without replacing it.
- **Labels** — every form input has a `<label htmlFor>` or `aria-label`.
- **Live regions** — `aria-live="polite"` on toast / inline alert containers so screen readers announce them.
- **Colour contrast** — meet WCAG AA at minimum (4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large text and UI). Don't rely on colour alone for state — pair with an icon or label.
- **`<img>` always has `alt`.** Decorative images get `alt=""`, not no attribute.

Run `axe-core` or Lighthouse against new pages before merge.

## Linting, formatting, type checking

| Concern | Tool |
|---|---|
| Linter | ESLint + `eslint-plugin-react` + `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` + `@typescript-eslint` |
| Formatter | Prettier (or Biome) |
| Type check | `tsc --noEmit` |
| Build | Vite (or Next.js) |

CI runs all four. Failing any of them fails the build.

## Testing

Frontend test conventions live in their own skill — load it when writing or reviewing tests:

- **`cmo-core/testing-standards`** — universal rules (tier model, two-level Jira traceability, parallelism, scenario coverage, anti-flake, naming, test data, source-mirror layout).
- **`cmo-frontend/frontend-testing`** — the frontend-specific *how*: Vitest, React Testing Library, MSW, TanStack Query in tests, Playwright for E2E.

## Quick reference

| Aspect | Rule |
|---|---|
| Business logic | Backend only. Frontend mirrors for UX. |
| Component style | Function components + hooks; no class components in new code |
| TypeScript | `"strict": true`, `.tsx` always |
| File-per-component | One component per `.tsx` file, PascalCase name |
| Exports | Named, not default |
| Server state | TanStack Query — never `fetch` / `axios` direct from a component |
| Client state | Zustand (default) or Context (narrow); never mirror server data |
| Local state | `useState` (or `useReducer` for state machines) |
| Props | `Props` type alias, never mutated, booleans default `false` |
| `useEffect` | Last resort — most uses belong in TanStack Query or `useMemo` |
| Memoisation | `memo` / `useMemo` / `useCallback` only with a profile or dep-array reason |
| Routing | React Router 6 data routers, lazy-loaded route elements |
| Forms | React Hook Form + Zod; client-side validation is a hint, not a boundary |
| Accessibility | Semantic HTML, labels, contrast, keyboard reachability |
| Lint / format / types | ESLint + plugins, Prettier/Biome, `tsc --noEmit` — CI gates all |
| Tests | See `cmo-core/testing-standards` + `cmo-frontend/frontend-testing` |
